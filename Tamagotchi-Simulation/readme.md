The Tamagotchi (たまごっち, IPA: [tamaɡotꜜtɕi]) is a handheld digital pet that was created in Japan by Akihiro Yokoi of WiZ and Aki Maita of Bandai. It was released by Bandai on November 23, 1996 in Japan and on May 1, 1997 in the rest of the world, quickly becoming one of the biggest toy fads of the late 1990s and the early 2000s. As of 2010, over 76 million Tamagotchis had been sold worldwide.[1] As of 2017, over 82 million units have been sold.[2] Most Tamagotchi are housed in a small egg-shaped computer with an interface consisting of three buttons.

In This experimental Project I will try to make a simulator using Python which going to simulate the functions of the handheld.

Functions Include the Mood selection, Hungry level fractuation and other randomize stuff.


It is open to contribution and it will be appreciated.
